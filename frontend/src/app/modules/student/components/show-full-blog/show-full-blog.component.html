      <strong>Computer Science:&nbsp;</strong>Algorithms form the basis of
      computer programming and are used to solve problems ranging from simple
      sorting and searching to complex tasks such as artificial intelligence and
      machine learning.
    </li>
    <li value="2">
      <strong>Mathematics:&nbsp;</strong>Algorithms are used to solve
      mathematical problems, such as finding the optimal solution to a system of
      linear equations or finding the shortest path in a graph.
    </li>
    <li value="3">
      <strong>Operations Research</strong>: Algorithms are used to optimize and
      make decisions in fields such as transportation, logistics, and resource
      allocation.
    </li>
    <li value="4">
      <strong>Artificial Intelligence:&nbsp;</strong>Algorithms are the
      foundation of artificial intelligence and machine learning, and are used
      to develop intelligent systems that can perform tasks such as image
      recognition, natural language processing, and decision-making.
    </li>
    <li value="5">
      <strong>Data Science:</strong>&nbsp;Algorithms are used to analyze,
      process, and extract insights from large amounts of data in fields such as
      marketing, finance, and healthcare.

    It can be understood by taking the example of cooking a new recipe. To cook
    a new recipe, one reads the instructions and steps and executes them one by
    one, in the given sequence. The result thus obtained is the new dish is
    cooked perfectly. Every time you use your phone, computer, laptop, or
    calculator you are using Algorithms. Similarly, algorithms help to do a task
    in programming to get the expected output.

    As one would not follow any written instructions to cook the recipe, but
    only the standard one. Similarly, not all written instructions for
    programming are an algorithm. For some instructions to be an algorithm, it
    must have the following characteristics:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li value="1">
      <strong>Clear and Unambiguous</strong>: The algorithm should be
      unambiguous. Each of its steps should be clear in all aspects and must
      lead to only one meaning.
    </li>
    <li value="2">
      <strong>Well-Defined Inputs</strong>: If an algorithm says to take inputs,
      it should be well-defined inputs. It may or may not take input.
    </li>
    <li value="3">
      <strong>Well-Defined Outputs:</strong>&nbsp;The algorithm must clearly
      define what output will be yielded and it should be well-defined as well.
      It should produce at least 1 output.
    </li>
    <li value="4">
      <strong>Finite-ness:</strong>&nbsp;The algorithm must be finite, i.e. it
      should terminate after a finite time.
    </li>
    <li value="5">
      <strong>Feasible:</strong>&nbsp;The algorithm must be simple, generic, and
      practical, such that it can be executed with the available resources. It
      must not contain some future technology or anything.
    </li>
    <li value="6">
      <strong>Language Independent:</strong>&nbsp;The Algorithm designed must be
      language-independent, i.e. it must be just plain instructions that can be
      implemented in any language, and yet the output will be the same, as
      expected.
    </li>
    <li value="7">
      <strong>Input</strong>: An algorithm has zero or more inputs. Each that
      contains a fundamental operator must accept zero or more inputs.
    </li>
    <li value="8">
      &nbsp;<strong>Output</strong>: An algorithm produces at least one output.
      Every instruction that contains a fundamental operator must accept zero or
      more inputs.
    </li>
    <li value="9">
      <strong>Definiteness:</strong>&nbsp;All instructions in an algorithm must
      be unambiguous, precise, and easy to interpret. By referring to any of the
      instructions in an algorithm one can clearly understand what is to be
      done. Every fundamental operator in instruction must be defined without
      any ambiguity.
    </li>
    <li value="10">
      <strong>Finiteness:</strong>&nbsp;An algorithm must terminate after a
      finite number of steps in all test cases. Every instruction which contains
      a fundamental operator must be terminated within a finite amount of time.
      Infinite loops or recursive functions without base conditions do not
      possess finiteness.
    </li>
    <li value="11">
      <strong>Effectiveness:&nbsp;</strong>An algorithm must be developed by
      using very basic, simple, and feasible operations so that one can trace it
      out by using just paper and pencil.
